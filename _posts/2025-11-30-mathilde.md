In the digital realm, words spread faster than intentions. A single post can ignite tension between distant communities, leaving traces that reshape their emotional landscapes. This project tells the story of how online hostility unfolds, lingers, and transforms the language of those it touches. Focusing on Reddit communities from 2014 to 2017, the project explores how conflicts between subreddits reveal deeper patterns of collective emotion, examining how anger spreads and how communities recover. It also considers how repeated clashes may harden or exhaust communities over time. By tracing these emotional aftershocks, the project seeks to understand not just moments of division, but the fragile processes of linguistic healing that follow. Beyond individual disputes, it asks how local conflicts mirror broader societal shifts, from everyday tensions to global political events. The aim is to uncover what our digital language reveals about resilience, contagion, and the shared emotional life of online communities.


This project investigates the dynamics of inter-community conflict on Reddit, treating language as a measurable indicator of social friction. We explore how verbal attacks between subreddits function as linguistic weapons, how communities recover, and whether repeated exposure to conflict creates a snowball effect of negativity. By linking these digital battles to real-world political events, like the 2016 U.S. presidential election, we aim to reveal the profound connection between online discourse and the offline world.

Our work is guided by four key areas of inquiry:

-**Words as Weapons & Linguistic Recovery**
How do targeted attacks from one subreddit against another affect the victim community's language? We measure how long it takes for a community's linguistic "tone" to return to normal after a conflict and how the characteristics of the attack itself shape the victim's response.

-**Predicting Conflict Through Language**
    Can a community's linguistic profile predict its role in a conflict network? We map subreddits into macro-clusters and study how their baseline communication styles relate to the spread of conflict between them.

-**The Real-World Echo: U.S. Politics**
    How do major political events reshape online discourse? We track the evolution of language in political subreddits before and after the 2016 U.S. election, measuring collective reaction and the shifting linguistic divide between opposing communities.


To answer these questions, we employ a multi-method framework:

-**Defining Conflict**: We operationalize a "conflict" as a documented negative hyperlink from a source subreddit to a target subreddit.

-**Linguistic Analysis**: Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework, we quantify emotional, cognitive, and social aspects of language in millions of posts.

-**Statistical & Causal Modeling**:

We use T-tests to identify significant shifts in a community's language after being attacked.

We employ Random Forest models to determine which linguistic features in an attack are the strongest predictors of damage in the target community—identifying the most potent verbal weapons.

We perform causal analysis to assess the effect of repeated exposure to conflict.


# Mapping the Digital Battleground: A Lens into Community Interactions

To understand the emotional life of online communities, we first need a map of their interactions. Our dataset is precisely that: a dynamic, living record of how Reddit communities act and react about one another.

## The data: A Network of Links

This dataset is a Directed Hyperlink Network. Think of it not as a list of isolated posts, but as a vast web of digital pathways connecting different community islands. Each data point is an exchange between two subreddits. 

A **Link** as a Social Act: A link is never just a URL. It is a gesture laden with meaning. It could be a bridge of solidarity, as when r/technology champions a discussion in r/Futurology. Or, it could be a link embedded in a post of critique or mockery.

### Decoding the Data:

- **`SOURCE_SUBREDDIT`**: The instigator, the community initiating the conversation.

- **`TARGET_SUBREDDIT`**: The subject, the community being talked about.

- **`POST_ID` & `TIMESTAMP`**: The unique fingerprint and the exact moment of the interaction, allowing us to trace the evolution of conflicts over time.

- **`PROPERTIES`**: The heart of the message. This metadata contains the raw text of the post and, crucially, its LIWC analysis—the quantified emotional and psychological signature of the communication.


### What is LIWC 

To move beyond mere words and into the realm of psychology, we employ **Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count** (LIWC). This tool acts as our linguistic microscope, allowing us to see the hidden emotional and cognitive structures within the text.

The Core Principle: The language a community uses is a window into its collective mind. The words we choose betray our anxieties, our anger, our analytical tendencies, and our social drives.

How it Works: LIWC scans millions of words from our dataset, categorizing them into psychologically meaningful dimensions. It doesn't just read the text; it interprets it, outputting scores that tell us, for instance, that a particular post is 8% focused on anger or 12% driven by analytical thinking. This transforms subjective rhetoric into measurable, comparable data.

### A Portrait of the Dataset

The following visualizations offer a high-level portrait of the language that defines our digital landscape. The "sunburn" plots below reveal the most dominant psychological and linguistic features across the entire network, showing us the common emotional vocabulary of Reddit.



## Tracing the Contours of Conflict

With our map and microscope in hand, we can now trace the flow of negativity itself. How does hostility manifest, and how does it spread through the network over time?
The Emotional Dichotomy of Interaction

The word clouds below crystallize the stark contrast between positive and negative engagements. One is a landscape of cohesion and reward; the other, a storm of anger and negation. This dichotomy is the fundamental emotional dynamic of inter-community conflict.

The Pulse of Negativity Over Time

When does conflict flare up? The following timelines zoom from years down to days, revealing the rhythms and eruptions of online hostility. We can see the long-term trends and pinpoint the specific days when the digital world held its breath.

**Identifying the Verbal Arsenal**

Not all negative language is created equal. Some words are more potent weapons than others. Using a Random Forest model, we sifted through the linguistic features of hostile posts to identify which ones are the most powerful predictors of a message being negative. The following chart reveals the most damaging elements in the verbal arsenal—the sharpest tools used in digital conflict.



# Analysis of Conflict Impact : Words as weapons: how do inter-subreddit conflicts affect victims’ linguistic recovery?

## How does the conflict LIWC characteristics impact the afterward interaction tones of the targeted subreddit ?

To study if a conflict change the LIWc characteristics of the targeted subreddit, a t-test is performed to study if their post LIWC differ from their baseline one.

## The Rhythm of Recovery: How Communities Heal Their Linguistic Scars
When a community is targeted by a hostile post, its language doesn't simply snap back to normal. The emotional shockwave reverberates through subsequent conversations, creating what we might call a linguistic recovery curve, i.e. the time it takes for a community's distinctive voice to return to its baseline after being disrupted by conflict.

Using time-series analysis, we tracked how key psychological markers in targeted subreddits evolved over 48-hour periods following an attack. The visualization below reveals both the immediate impact and the gradual healing process across different dimensions of language:


Our analysis reveals distinct patterns in how different psychological features respond to and recover from conflict. **Social language and cognitive mechanisms show the most pronounced decreases after attacks**, dropping by -0.0003 and -0.0001 respectively. This suggests communities respond to hostility by becoming less socially engaged and reducing their analytical thinking. This behaviour is shared by positive motion, agreeement and dissent relative worlds. **Negative emotions show the largest increase** , with also rises in swear worlds, anger, sadness and anxiety vocabulary. 

The Recovery Timeline: Fast Bounces and Lasting Scars

The recovery timeline reveals even more compelling insights. While most features recover relatively quickly (within 11.8-12.4 hours), **many communities never fully return to baseline in the 48 hours window** for certain linguistic features. Most strikingly:

- **Cognitive mechanisms never recover in 37.6% of cases**
- **Social language never recovers in  33.8%% of cases** (4,548/14,698)  
- **Positive emotion never recovers in  27.6%% of cases** (3,318/14,698)

The recovery histogram below allows us to explore how long these linguistic disruptions typically persist across different psychological dimensions.

**Agreement, disagreement, and anxiety show the fastest recovery** (11.6 hours), demonstrating resilience in these communicative functions. However, the high rates of non-recovery for cognitive and social language suggest that attacks may cause **lasting changes in how communities process information and interact socially**.

While the immediate emotional spike of negativity and anxiety is short-lived, the most profound impact of a hostile post is a sustained reduction in social and analytical language. This indicates that communities may not just be "hurt" in the short term but can be fundamentally altered, becoming less cohesive and less thoughtful in their discourse long after the initial attack has passed.

## The Contagion of Conflict: How Attacker Language Shapes Victim Response ?

When one community attacks another, the emotional tone of the assault itself may determine how deeply the target is wounded. We investigated whether specific linguistic features in hostile posts act as psychological triggers, creating predictable patterns in how victim communities respond.

Using correlation analysis across multiple time segments, we traced how the emotional and cognitive composition of an attack influences the subsequent linguistic shifts in the targeted community. The visualization below reveals which attacker features create the strongest ripple effects.



Our analysis reveals that **profanity in attacks emerges as the most powerful linguistic trigger**, with swear words in hostile posts showing the strongest overall influence on victim responses. The data shows clear patterns of emotional contagion and behavioral mirroring:

- **Swear words in attacks trigger anger responses**: The strongest correlation (r = 0.021) links attacker profanity to increased anger language in victim communities
- **Victims mirror profanity**: Target communities significantly increase their own swear word usage when attacked with profanity (r = 0.020)
- **Sexual language escalates**: Attacks containing profanity also correlate with increased sexual language in responses (r = 0.019)

Interestingly, **religious language in attacks correlates with increased social language** in victim responses (r = 0.017), suggesting that communities may respond to religious-themed attacks by strengthening social bonds. Conversely, **sadness in attacks correlates with reduced social language** in targets (r = -0.016), indicating that emotionally vulnerable attacks may suppress community engagement.

While these correlations are statistically significant, the effect sizes are generally small, suggesting that while attacker language does influence victim responses, the relationships are subtle and mediated by many other factors.

Granger Causality Analysis: The Impact of Attacks on Negative Behavior

We used **Granger causality tests** to determine whether being attacked (receiving negative sentiment posts) causally influences a community's subsequent negative behavior. The test examines whether knowledge of past values in one time series (attacks received) improves the prediction of another series (negative behavior emitted).
**Significance threshold**: p-value < 0.05


### 🏛️ News and Politics Communities - Immediate Effects

- **r/worldnews** (Hourly Frequency)
    - **Strong causal effect**: Significant at lags 1-2
    - **Implication**: Immediate negative response that persists for 2 hours
    - **Pattern**: Community reacts to attacks with short-term effect

-**r/subredditdrama** (Hourly Frequency) 
    - **Most robust causal effect**: Significant at lags 1-5
    - **Implication**: Extremely reactive community where attacks trigger prolonged cycles of negativity 
    - **Special feature**: The only subreddit with significance at all hourly lags
    
-**r/the_donald** 
    - **Hourly Frequency**: Significant effect at lags 2-5
    - **Daily Frequency**: Significant effect at lags 4-5
    - **Implication**: Delayed response but medium- and long-term effects 

-**r/gaming** (Hourly Frequency)
    - **Delayed and prolonged effect**: Significant at lags 2-5
    - **Implication**: The gaming community reacts after a delay but maintains negativity 

### 📱 Diverse Communities - Varied Patterns
- **r/wtf** (Hourly Frequency)

- **r/kotakuinaction**
- **Hourly Frequency**: Significant effect at lags 3-5
- **Daily Frequency**: Significant effect at lags 1 and 3
- **Implication**: Complex dynamics with short-term (daily) and medium-term (hourly) effects## Analysis of Time Patterns

### ⏱️ Response Timing

**Immediate Effects (Lag 1)** :

- r/worldnews, r/news, r/politics, r/subredditdrama- *Communities that react within an hour of the attack*

**Delayed Effects (Lag 2-3)** :- r/the_donald, r/gaming, r/tifu, r/wtf, r/kotakuinaction  - *Communities where negative responses emerge after 2-3 hours*

**Persistent Effects (Lag 4-5)** :- 7 out of 9 communities show significant effects at lags 4-5- *Indicates cycles of negativity that persist for several hours*

### 📊 Robustness of Effects

**Most robust effects** (multiple lags and frequencies):
1. **r/subredditdrama** (5 hourly lags)
2. **r/the_donald** (4 hourly lags + 2 daily lags)
3. **r/tifu** (4 hourly lags + 2 daily lags)
4. **r/gaming** (4 hourly lags)

### Key Findings

1. **Universality of the Effect**: 9 distinct communities show evidence of Granger causality, covering news, politics, gaming, and entertainment.
 2. **Specific Temporal Dynamics**:   
 - **News communities**: immediate but short responses (1-2 lags)   
 - **Engaged communities**: delayed but prolonged responses (2-5 lags)  
  - **r/subredditdrama**: exception with immediate AND prolonged response

3. **Persistence of Effects**: The majority of communities show significant effects even 4-5 hours after the initial attack

4. **Consistency Across Communities**: Despite thematic differences, the pattern of negative response to attacks appears to be a cross-cutting phenomenon

### Implications

These results suggest that **online attacks systematically create cycles of negativity** that spread across different types of communities. The persistence of effects (often 4-5 hours) indicates that digital conflicts can have a substantial “half-life,” influencing the tone of discussions well beyond the initial incident.

The variation in temporal patterns suggests that different communities develop distinct “conflict rhythms,” potentially related to their culture, size, or main theme.
