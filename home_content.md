# Introduction

{% include_relative figs/intro_pic.html %}

<!-- Text reviewed -->
In the digital realm, words spread faster than intentions. A single post can ignite tension between distant communities, leaving traces that reshape their emotional landscapes. This project tells the story of how online hostility unfolds, lingers, and transforms the language of those affected by it. Focusing on Reddit communities from 2014 to 2017, the project examines how conflicts between subreddits reveal deeper patterns of collective emotion. It explores how anger spreads and how communities recover. It also considers how repeated clashes may harden or exhaust communities over time. By tracing these emotional aftershocks, the project seeks to understand not only moments of division, but also linguistic healing process. Beyond individual disputes, the project asks how local conflicts mirror broader societal shifts, from everyday tensions to global political events. Our goal is to reveal what our digital language reveals about resilience, contagion, and the shared emotional life of online communities.

<!-- Text reviewed -->
This project investigates the dynamics of conflict between Reddit communities, considering language as a measurable indicator of social friction. Specifically, we examine how verbal attacks between subreddits can function as linguistic weapons, how communities recover from them, and whether repeated exposure to conflict can create a snowball effect of negativity. By linking these digital battles to real-world political events related to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, we aim to reveal the profound connection between online discourse and the offline world.
